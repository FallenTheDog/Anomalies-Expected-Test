						<text>Material properties of recently aquired archotechnology\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report details observations from Subject {PAWN_nameDef} regarding the visible properties of the aquired shard. The shard is equivalent in physical properties to the ones observed earlier, however this one is way larger in size. One side also appears to be incredibly sharp, calculations showing it to be mere nanometers in length. Any further observations yielded nothing of it's other properties. It is advised we wait for any activity from the object.\n\nObservations:\n{PAWN_nameDef} Reported morphological identity to other archotechnological shards, disregarding it's size.\nItem's sharpness was noted.\nCalculations show that the sharp side measures multiple nanometers in length.\nNo physical changes were observed post-contact.\n\nFindings:\nOnly the item's extraordinary sharpness is noted.\n\nDiscussion:\nThese finding suggests a potential existence of a mechanism responsible for the item's anomalous sharpness. Since no other activity was observed, we suggest that either the item hasn't entered it's active state yet, or that the activity is not observable by any available means.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther experimentation/waiting is required. Additional tests with {PAWN_nameDef} and potentially other subjects are recommended to explore the potential of item's physical properties.</text>

						<text>Newly observed effects on colonist's health\n\nAbstract:\nThis report details observations concerning the newly discovered biological effects on the razor shard's wielder. Following its prolonged use, the wielder started to show symptoms not associated with any infection or disease. The pawn seems to be losing in constitution, becoming more pale and fragile, however at the same time more nimble, showing increase in manipulation and general flexibility. The pawn's organism also doesn't seem to have any immune reaction to this illness, suggesting it to be caused by a malfunction in the body itself. Given this observation, continued experimentation with the razor shard should be proceeded with caution. Further investigation into the shard's properties and its impact on colonists' health is warranted.\n\nObservations:\nFollowing the use of razor shard, a numerous symptoms were observed in the wielder.\nThe severity of those symptoms appears to be proportional to the time spent wielding the shard.\n\nDiscussion:\nThese findings suggest a potential unobservable force which both affects colonist's health and maintains shard's properties.\n\nRecommendations:\nGiven the potential detrimental effects, continued experimentation with the razor shard should be undertaken with caution, however further analysis of the shard's inner workings and its potential use is recommended.</text>

						<text>Theory Regarding the mechanism behind Razor Shard\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report presents a novel theory proposed by Subject {PAWN_nameDef} regarding the mechanism behind razor shard. Subject suggests that the shard might be infused with mechanites akin to a monosword, which seems to have properties somewhat identical to the shard. This theory is based on a recent observation from the wielder, during which the shard's use has led to one of it's parts breaking off, after which it seemed to reconstruct the missing part. This has also led to further progress in the pawn's illness, suggesting that the shard takes materials necessary for reconstruction directly from the body. Lack of bodily resources such as proteins seems to be the cause of observed symptoms. Because of that, we have suggested a way to counteract shard's effects with medication. As a result of this observation, the anomaly associated with the shard has been classified as Paritally Safe.\n\nHypothesis:\nFollowing the prolonged use of the razor shard, {PAWN_nameDef} has proposed a theory concerning the item. Subject suggest the shard utilizes it's own mechanites and subject's bodily resources to reconstruct it's edge. This interaction has various effects on the body, mainly decrease in constitution and increase in flexibility.\n\nProposed Mechanism:\n{PAWN_nameDef}'s theory suggests that mechanites inside of the shard can get into the wielder's body, after which they take and repurpose various organic resources. This change in physiology, in turn, would explain the observed changes in constitution.\n\nOutcome:\nBased on information gained during this observation, {PAWN_nameDef} has successfully classified the anomaly associated with razor shard as Partially Safe.\n\nConsiderations:\nThe potential validity of Subject's theory requires further investigation. Because the shard only exhibits activity when in direct contact with the pawn, no risk is associated with it.\n\nRecommendations:\nDisregard: Given the potential consequences related to the shard's prolonged use, ignoring it may be a viable course of action.\nControlled Use: Alternatively, considering that the item's properties can be extremely useful, continued use of the shard under some form of control could offer significant advantages in our settlement's security. This approach, however, necessitates thorough risk assessment and the development of safety protocols to safeguard colonists' well-being.</text>
